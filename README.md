## Overview
I have taken an example of **Garage Service Sales Data** which consists of **3 sheets** and all the details of the **type of services** the garage has performed and to which cars the services are being performed. One sheet contains the **cost of the type of service**, another contains all the **details of the cars**, including their model no., company name and licence plates and finally in the main sheet the **time and order numbers** of the cars were given. In this mini project, I have **cleaned the raw data** and merged 3 of the sheets into one sheet so that the data is present in one sheet only.


## Motivation

When we fetch the data from various software using APIs or in-house tools, the data most of the time is **not readable**. So the motivation behind this project is to use **MS Excel** to overcome the challenge to **make the data ready for analysis**. 


## Workflow

- Highlighted the duplicate data and then **removed** them.
- Checked for any spelling mistakes and corrected them accordingly using the "Find and Replace" feature.
- Took care of the blank cells using the "Go To Special" feature.
- The date and time were in the same cell so I separated them using the "Text To Columns" feature and then I converted the dates from general to the corrected date data type.
- Took care of the blank cells using the "Go To Special" feature.
- Merged the price sheet with the main sheet, which denotes the price of each and every service using xlookup formula.
- Merged the car details sheet with the main sheet, which denotes all the details of the car that is being serviced using the xlookup formula.


## Challenges-I-Faced
Had to clean the data in less than 3 hours of time because of the deadline so this project was pretty fast-paced.
