## Overview
I have taken an example of **Garage Service Sales Data** which consists of **3 sheets** and all the details of the **type of services** the garage has performed and to which cars the services are being performed. One sheet contains the **cost of the type of service**, another contains all the **details of the cars**, including their model no., company name and licence plates and finally in the main sheet the **time and order numbers** of the cars were given. In this mini project, I have **cleaned the raw data** and merged 3 of the sheets into one sheet so that the data is present in one sheet only.


## Motivation

When we fetch the data from various software using APIs or in-house tools, the data most of the time is **not readable**. So the motivation behind this project is to use **MS Excel** to overcome the challenge to **make the data ready for analysis**. 


## Workflow

- **Highlighted** the duplicate data and then **removed** them.
- **Checked** for any **spelling mistakes** and corrected them accordingly using the **"Find and Replace"** feature.
- Took care of the **blank cells** using the **"Go To Special"** feature.
- The **date and time were in the same cell** so I separated them using the **"Text To Columns"** feature and then I **converted** the **dates** from **general** to the **corrected date data type**.
- **Merged the price sheet** with the main sheet, which denotes the price of each and every service using **xlookup formula**.
- **Merged the car details sheet** with the main sheet, which denotes all the details of the car that is being serviced using the **xlookup formula**.


## Challenges-I-Faced
Had to clean the data in less than 3 hours of time because of the deadline so this project was pretty fast-paced.
